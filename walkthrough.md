# IndexNow Implementation Walkthrough

I have implemented the necessary components to enable IndexNow functionality for your website.

## Changes Made

### 1. Verification File
I created a verification file at [767600b997d5400da8612db14af2df15.txt](./public/767600b997d5400da8612db14af2df15.txt) in the `public/` directory.
- This file contains your API key: `767600b997d5400da8612db14af2df15`.
- It is live and accessible at `https://wealthsimple-referral-canada.vercel.app/767600b997d5400da8612db14af2df15.txt`.

### 2. Submission Script
I created a Node.js script at [indexnow.js](./scripts/indexnow.js) and successfully executed it.
- The URLs `https://wealthsimple-referral-canada.vercel.app/` and `https://wealthsimple-referral-canada.vercel.app/fr` have been submitted to Bing's IndexNow API.
- The server returned a `200 OK` response, confirming successful submission.

## Results

- **Verification File Status**: ✅ Live
- **IndexNow Submission**: ✅ Success

## How to Verify Indexing

Indexing isn't always instant, but you can track it here:

1.  **Bing Webmaster Tools**:
    - Go to [Bing Webmaster Tools](https://www.bing.com/webmasters/).
    - Navigate to **IndexNow** in the sidebar.
    - You will see a history of submitted URLs and their status.
2.  **Bing Search**:
    - Search for `site:wealthsimple-referral-canada.vercel.app` on Bing.
    - If your pages appear, they have been indexed.

> [!NOTE]
> IndexNow speeds up the process by "pushing" the content to Bing, but it still might take a few hours or days for Bing to crawl and display the pages in search results.
